# Hierarchical Learning-based Graph Partition for Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems (AAMAS 2025)
# Multi-level Graph Partition via Hierarchical Learning for Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems (JAAMAS 2026)

## Introduction
This is the official PyTorch implementation for the paper 
["Hierarchical Learning-based Graph Partition for Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08340),
as well as its extended version ["Multi-level Graph Partition via Hierarchical Learning for Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems"]().
The paper presents the HLGP framework, a new divide-and-conquer approach that combines global and local partition policies in graph partitioning tasks for subsequent node permutation. 
This method enables the scaling of neural solvers for the vehicle routing problem to handle over 10,000 nodes efficiently.
## Dependencies

Before executing the training process, please ensure that the necessary requirements have been installed.
```
conda create -n hlgp_env python=3.8
pip install torch==1.11.0+cu113 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training

**RL-driven HLGP**
```
bash train_hlgp_rl.sh
```

**SL-driven HLGP**
```
bash train_hlgp_sl.sh
```
